# ACCOUNT INFORMATION
# NOTE: This config assumes that an app-specific password for Gmail is stored in
# the keychain. This can be done with the following command:
# security add-internet-password -a matthew.lincoln@gmail.com \
#   -l imap.gmail.com -r imap -s imap.gmail.com -w app-specific-password -U
IMAPAccount gmail
Host imap.gmail.com

# THEN WE SPECIFY THE LOCAL AND REMOTE STORAGE
# - THE REMOTE STORAGE IS WHERE WE GET THE MAIL FROM (E.G., THE
#   SPECIFICATION OF AN IMAP ACCOUNT)
# - THE LOCAL STORAGE IS WHERE WE STORE THE EMAIL ON OUR COMPUTER

# REMOTE STORAGE (USE THE IMAP ACCOUNT SPECIFIED ABOVE)
IMAPStore gmail-remote
Account gmail

# LOCAL STORAGE (CREATE DIRECTORIES with mkdir -p Maildir/gmail)
MaildirStore gmail-local
Path ~/.mail/gmail/
Inbox ~/.mail/gmail/INBOX

# CONNECTIONS SPECIFY LINKS BETWEEN REMOTE AND LOCAL FOLDERS
#
# CONNECTIONS ARE SPECIFIED USING PATTERNS, WHICH MATCH REMOTE MAIl
# FOLDERS. SOME COMMONLY USED PATTERS INCLUDE:
#
# 1 "*" TO MATCH EVERYTHING
# 2 "!DIR" TO EXCLUDE "DIR"
# 3 "DIR" TO MATCH DIR
